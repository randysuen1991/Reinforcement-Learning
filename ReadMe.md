# Reinforcement Module
This module stores reinforcement learning models and the meta class of the environment matching these models.

## Traditional Reinforcement Learning
There are going to be several algorithms, including Sarsa algorithm, Q-learning algorithm.

## Deep Q Learning
In this file, you could find many variants of Deep Q model, like Double Deep Q Learning, Deep Q Learning with Priority Reply, 
... .

## Policy Gradient
There is a fundamental policy gradient model object in this file.

## Actor Critic
There are many actor-critic based models in this file.
