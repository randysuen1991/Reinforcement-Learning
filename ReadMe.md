# Reinforcement Module
This module consists of two parts. The first one is about the traditional reinforcement learning. The other one is about the 
deep reinforcement learning.

## Traditional Reinforcement Learning
There are going to be several algorithms, including Sarsa algorithm, Q-learning algorithm.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep Q Learning is the base of many derivative algorithms, like Double Deep Q Learning, Deep Q Learning with Priority Reply, 
... .
